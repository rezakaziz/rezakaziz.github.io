This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
# Welcome

- Hugo :rocket:
- Hugo theme :rocket:

Don't forget to check the README.md file!
```

Remember that you can also specify a section header for the posts below by configuring the `mainSectionsTitle` parameter in the front matter of this file.

I’m an engineer who enjoys building systems where reliability, observability, security, and
privacy are first-class concerns.

My focus is on designing and operating systems that remain understandable and trustworthy under real-world constraints: failures, adversarial behavior, and scale.

### Areas of work

- **Observability & Reliability**  
> I design and operate observability foundations that make complex distributed
systems understandable, detectable, and operable under real-world failure
conditions.

- **Security & Detection**  
> I work on detection and response mechanisms that help systems remain secure
under adversarial conditions, focusing on visibility, verification, and
operational effectiveness rather than assumptions.

- **Privacy & Trust**  
> I integrate privacy-preserving and verifiable mechanisms into distributed
systems, with a focus on realistic threat models, performance trade-offs, and
operational constraints.
