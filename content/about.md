I’m an engineer who enjoys building **reliable systems** and understanding how things work beneath the surface.

My background is rooted in **Linux systems, networking, and infrastructure**, and naturally evolved toward **DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering**. I work on designing, automating, and operating production environments using **containers, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code**, with a strong focus on **reliability, observability, and simplicity**.

Alongside my engineering work, I conduct research in **trustworthy AI**, with a particular focus on **privacy-preserving and verifiable machine learning systems**. My work explores topics such as **federated learning, differential privacy, cryptographic verification, and zero-knowledge proofs**, aiming to build AI systems that are not only performant, but also **transparent, auditable, and worthy of trust**.

This research mindset strongly influences how I approach engineering problems: questioning assumptions, measuring impact, and favoring long-term robustness over quick fixes.

I care deeply about:
- Automating repetitive work  
- Making systems observable and predictable  
- Reducing complexity instead of adding layers  
- Building infrastructure and AI systems that engineers and users can trust  

Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with homelabs, learning by breaking and rebuilding systems, and sharing knowledge. I believe good engineering is less about chasing tools and more about **clarity, ownership, and resilience**.

> I’m always curious, always learning, and always looking to build systems that scale — not just in size, but in reliability and trust.
