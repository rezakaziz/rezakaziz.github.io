I’m an engineer who enjoys building systems where reliability, observability, security, and
privacy are first-class concerns. My area of work are the following : 


- **Observability & Reliability**  
> I design and operate observability foundations that make complex distributed
systems understandable, detectable, and operable under real-world failure
conditions.

- **Security & Detection**  
> I work on detection and response mechanisms that help systems remain secure
under adversarial conditions, focusing on visibility, verification, and
operational effectiveness rather than assumptions.

- **Privacy & Trust**  
> I integrate privacy-preserving and verifiable mechanisms into distributed
systems, with a focus on realistic threat models, performance trade-offs, and
operational constraints.

## Research Activities
My research activities are driven by a strong interest in building reliable, trustworthy, and responsible digital systems. I'm interested by the following topics
- Cybersecurity for AI and AI for Cybersecurity.
- Network security, attack detection, and trust modeling.
- Privacy and data protection.
- Cryptography and Zero-Knowledge Proofs for secure and verifiable systems.
- Security, reliability, and observability of complex systems.
