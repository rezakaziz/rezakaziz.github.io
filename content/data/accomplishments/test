## 🔐 Privacy-Preserving Computation

A central concept explored in this thesis is **Homomorphic Encryption**.

This cryptographic technique allows computations to be performed directly on **encrypted data**, meaning:
- raw data is never exposed to the cloud,
- processing can be outsourced securely,
- only authorized parties can decrypt the results.

While promising, homomorphic encryption introduces strong constraints that significantly impact how data analysis algorithms can be designed and executed.

## 🧩 The Reality of Missing Data

In real-world systems, data is rarely complete:
- sensors may malfunction,
- values may be lost during transmission,
- users may omit information.

Most clustering algorithms assume complete datasets, which limits their applicability in practice.

This thesis examines how existing clustering techniques address:
- **missing values**,
- **cryptographic computation constraints**,
- and the combination of both challenges.
