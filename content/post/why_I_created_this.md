I created this website for a simple reason:  
to have a place to think in public about systems I build, operate, or study.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of **infrastructure, reliability,
security, and trust**. These are areas where problems rarely come from a single
bug or missing tool, but from **implicit assumptions** that go unnoticed until
systems fail, degrade, or get attacked.

This site is not meant to be a portfolio of tools or a collection of tutorials.
There are already excellent resources for that. Instead, it is a place to
document how I reason about systems: what breaks in practice, why certain design
choices age poorly, and what trade-offs tend to matter more than expected.

## Why not just LinkedIn or GitHub?

Short-form platforms reward visibility, not depth.  
Repositories show *what* was built, but rarely *why* it was designed that way.

Many of the most important engineering decisions live **between code and
operations**: in architecture choices, observability gaps, threat models, and
operational constraints. Those are hard to capture in a tweet or a README, but
they deserve to be written down.

This website gives me a slower medium, where I can:
- explain context,
- question assumptions,
- and revisit ideas as my understanding evolves.

## What I plan to write about

Most posts here will revolve around a few recurring themes:

- **Observability as a foundation** for reliability and security  
- **Failure modes** in distributed and infrastructure systems  
- **Detection and response** under real-world constraints  
- **Trust and verification**, especially in privacy- and security-critical systems  
- The gap between **theoretical guarantees** and operational reality  

Some posts may be technical, others more reflective, but all are grounded in
systems thinking rather than tools or trends.

## How to read this site

Nothing here should be taken as universal truth or best practice.

These are **working notes**, written from experience and curiosity, often shaped
by things that went wrong, behaved unexpectedly, or raised uncomfortable
questions. When possible, I try to be explicit about assumptions and trade-offs,
and honest about uncertainty.

If something here helps you reason more clearly about a system you’re building
or operating, then the site has served its purpose.

## A final note

Good engineering, in my experience, is less about chasing the right tools and
more about:
- clarity of intent,
- ownership of systems,
- and respect for complexity.

This website is simply an extension of that mindset.

More writing will follow.
